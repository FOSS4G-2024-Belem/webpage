<span>Submit a talk</span></a></center><h1 id=description>Description</h1><p>Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Europe is the regional
flagship event of OSGeo - an open, grassroots and dynamic community. We are
looking for novel and original submissions on development, use, and advocacy
for FOSS4G over a wider array of topics ranging from state-of-software to
specific use cases, from building and sustaining a community to building a
business around FOSS4G technology, from software technical details to
democratic processes and policy making.</p><p>Whether you are a seasoned FOSS4Ger or it would be your first time presenting,
we are very happy to welcome your submission - the conference series and the
whole FOSS4G community flourishes on the shared experiences and knowledge
of its presenters.</p><p>As this is a regional OSGeo event we are more concentrated on themes related to
European topics, activities, and possibilities. But as we live in an
interconnected World the themes will not be limited to Europe only.</p><p>Please keep in mind this is a Free and Open Source Software conference.
Submissions promoting restricted license / closed source software will not
be accepted.</p><h1 id=session-types>Session types</h1><p>A regular talk slot is 30 minutes long:</p><ul><li>20 minutes for the talk,</li><li>5 minutes for questions and answers, and</li><li>5 minutes for the participants to change rooms and next speaker setup.</li></ul><p>There is also a possibility to submit a lightning talk with a 5 minute speaker
slot, with 4 minutes for the talk, 1 minute for the next speaker setup.</p><p>We are preparing to host 5 parallel tracks with 1.5h long sessions, meaning we
will be able to host approximately 130 presentations in total.</p><h1 id=submitting-a-proposal>Submitting a proposal</h1><h3 id=1-general-topic>1. general topic</h3><p>When submitting your talk, you will be asked to select one general topic that
best defines your contribution. This will help us group similar-themed talks
to same tracks. The topics for general sessions are as follows</p><h5 id=--transition-to-foss4g>- Transition to FOSS4G</h5><p>Do you have a success story to share about transitioning a system or workflow
to FOSS4G technology? Maybe some lessons-learnt? We would like to hear about it,
and have you share your experiences with the rest of the community.</p><h5 id=--open-standards-and-interoperability-for-geospatial>- Open standards and interoperability for geospatial</h5><p>Open standards help us to be interoperable. They help us share and consume data.<br>Do you want to share the inner workings of your SDI? Or maybe you have thoughts
on implementing INSPIRE services? Or maybe you are building something
pan-European on top of INSPIRE? Updates on the European Union Location
Framework (EULF) Blueprint?</p><h5 id=--building-a-business-with-foss4g>- Building a business with FOSS4G</h5><p>You have built a business around supporting and maintaining a FOSS4G product.
It’s a different kind of attitude towards the users, and the product itself
with respect to the “traditional” closed source business model. How do you
manage that? What are some of the pitfalls, what are the gains with the
choices you’ve made.</p><h5 id=--state-of-software>- State of software</h5><p>Recent developments in Free and Open Source Software projects. Maybe tease the
audience with a sneak-peek of what’s to come in a release later in the year?</p><h5 id=--open-community>- Open community</h5><p>How do you engage people? What makes people want to contribute, and be part of
the community. Maybe your local OSGeo chapter? A software user-group? Or maybe
you’ve participated in a mapathon and want to share your thoughts. This is most
suitable for sharing experiences so we could all grow as individuals and build
and sustain our communities better. Sharing is caring.</p><h5 id=--foss4g-made-in-europe>- FOSS4G “Made in Europe”</h5><p>A special track to investigate and introduce the many Free and Open Source
software tools, data capture and collection and sharing projects carried out
at the European Commission, European institutions or funded by them.</p><h5 id=--open-data>- Open Data</h5><p>Open source software is a nice thing but it is of little use if there’s no
data to use it with. Are you using Open Data to build something? Or better yet,
are you producing Open Data? A dataset we haven’t heard about? Excellent! We
are all eager to find out about it, to make decision making processes more
transparent and democratic.</p><h5 id=--use-cases-and-applications>- Use cases and applications</h5><p>You have a very specific use case of doing things with Free and Open Source
Software. Maybe you are using AI to do Earth Observation? Or maybe routing?
Farming a flock of drones? Making sense of a gazillion points in space and
time? Something completely different that we didn’t even imagine Free and
Open Source Software could be used for? We are all eager to find novel and
interesting ways of solving geospatial puzzles, and to make existing workflows
smoother. Something will click in the audience’s heads after hearing your talk.</p><h5 id=--foss4g-in-education-and-research>- FOSS4G in education and research</h5><p>Are you an educator? And you are making your students use Free and Open Source
Software? Perfect! We’d like to hear from you how you have managed that.
What is the reaction of students? How do you engage them and how do you
introduce them to the wonderful world of Free and Open Source Software and
the communities that surround them?</p><h3 id=2-general-themes>2. General theme(s)</h3><p>In addition you’ll be asked to provide at least one general theme to describe
your submission (think of this as a keyword)</p><ul><li>Data collection, sharing</li><li>Data processing and analysis</li><li>Spatial machine learning</li><li>Data visualization</li><li>State of software, or new features</li><li>Business case around FOSS4G</li><li>FOSS4G at governmental institutions</li><li>FOSS4G and sustainable development goals (SDG)</li><li>FOSS4G for movement, transport, and networks. In space and time, by any subject (water, asphalt, people, birds, animals, air, or even cosmos)</li><li>FOSS4G for crisis / disaster response, civil defence</li><li>FOSS4G for land use planning, land management, monitoring, smart cities, population mapping</li><li>FOSS4G for ocean / marine monitoring</li><li>Drones, sensors, lasers, and remote sensing</li><li>FOSS4G for agriculture</li><li>IoT, indoor mapping</li><li>Standards, SDI, INSPIRE, interoperability</li><li>Education</li><li>Community building and participatory FOSS4G</li></ul><h3 id=3-level-of-difficulty>3. Level of difficulty</h3><p>And finally we would like to ask you to identify the level of technical
complexity of your presentation in a 3-point scale ranging from
“no previous knowledge needed” to “must be a superexpert to understand”.</p><h1 id=guidelines>Guidelines</h1><p>There are no formal indications when preparing your contribution for the
conference, but please consider the following suggestions:</p><ul><li>FOSS4G is - first and foremost - about open source, so make sure you
clearly indicate which projects are essential in your talk</li><li>If your talk is about developments in or a completely new project, please
point to the appropriate repository (or repositories)</li><li>Your talk would not be about development of software? Yes! Although software
development is in the heart of FOSS4G it is not the only purpose of the
conference. The goal is to bring together developers and users, policy makers
and open community advocates over the broad sphere of geospatial to share
experiences and showcase the power and reach of free and open source software.</li><li>The more suitable the selection of topic, theme, and technical complexity are,
the better shaped the final program will be. So, please, help us optimize
your time and make the best out of the conference.</li><li>Although we are working hard on bringing you good internet connectivity at
the venue, please don’t rely on it solely in your presentation. Things tend
to break exactly at the moment of live demonstrations.</li><li>We believe in equality, therefore please keep in mind the talk slot lengths
when preparing your presentation. But at the same time be prepared that the
hallway discussions on your presentation might continue until the early
hours of the morning.</li><li>FOSS4G is an open community of people from various, diverse backgrounds and
lived experiences. This is what makes us strong and we care for each other’s
well-being. Please keep in mind that a derogatory attitude towards other
people or their work is not welcome.</li><li>We are working on making streaming of presentations a reality, however the
conference presenters would be expected to be on-site</li><li>And lastly, the success of this event lies in the responsable actions of all
participants and organizers alike. If you have confirmed your participation
but later on you or the co-authors are no longer able to present, please let
us know as soon as possible.</li></ul><h1 id=selection-process>Selection process</h1><p>FOSS4G Europe is a <strong>community event</strong> and therefore the main selection of talks
will be done through an open community voting process. The highest-scoring
ones will automatically be included in the program, while others will be
reviewed by the volunteer <a href=../program-committee/><strong>Program Committee</strong></a>.</p><center><a href=https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-europe-2024/cfp class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" target=blank rel="noopener noreferrer" style=background:#f60;border:#f60;padding:32px;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px><img src=https://2024.europe.foss4g.org/images/icon/form-icon.png alt=CFP>
