Participate in the FOSS4G 2024 Community Sprint!

If you are interested in contributing to FOSS4G projects alongside other enthusiastic contributors, we look forward to welcoming you to the FOSS4G 2024 Community Sprint taking place during the weekend following the main conference.

The Community Sprint will take place on December 7th and 8th, at the University's facilities.

At FOSS4G we seek to make CodeSprint inclusive, this means taking specific steps to ensure that all participants feel welcome and have the opportunity to excel regardless of their skill level, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or any other characteristic.

To this end, we leave some guidelines that participants and mentors must follow:

- **Various Problems**
  - It is interesting to select problems that cover different themes and levels of difficulty. This will ensure there are challenges for participants of all levels and areas of experience.
- **Clear and Ethical Standards**
  - Establish clear norms and rules that promote ethics and mutual respect. This conference seeks to ensure that all participants are aware of these standards from the beginning.
- **Inclusive Communication**
  - We will use inclusive language in all CodeSprint-related communications. It is positive that instructions and messages are clear and not exclusive.
- **Platform Accessibility**
  - Select an accessible, open-source online platform for people with different needs and skills. Make sure the interface is easy to navigate and supports assistive technologies.
- **Pronouns and personal preferences**
  - We will ask and respect participants' pronouns and personal preferences. It is essential to include options in registration forms so that they can express their identity comfortably.
- **Diversity in mentoring**
  - If there are interested parties in mentoring, it should be diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity and abilities. This will contribute to a more equitable assessment.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**
  - Let us be mindful of cultural sensitivity when selecting issues and establishing standards. Avoid content that may be offensive to different cultures.
- **Accessible Features**
  - If you are interested in being a mentor, it would be ideal if there were additional resources and references to help participants with their work. This may include tutorials, links to documentation, and other supporting materials.
