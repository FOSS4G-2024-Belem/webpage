## About FOSS4G 2024
The Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4E) conference is the
Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) annual
conference.

OSGeo is the largest and most important international organization
that unites the community of developers, users, and advocates of free and
open source in geospatial.

The main focus of the organization is fostering the development, maintenance
and use of free and open source software for geospatial, open standards, and
open data. The democratizing nature of the field creates a basis for sharing
geographic data, promotes cooperation between organizations and individuals,
and enables the application of data in solving the most diverse everyday
problems, being the basis for such fields as map applications, logistics,
transport, infrastructure planning, organizing rescue work in
disaster areas, etc.

FOSS4G is a community event organized by volunteers, with a focus on
building a diverse and sustainable open community, sharing our own experiences
and learning from others. Although it is software that brings us together, it's
the deep care for the society and the environment that surrounds us, helping
solve the World's problems one bit at a time, that connects us.

The international conference series started in 2004 under the name FOSS/GRASS
User Conference and has been known as FOSS4G since 2006. It was recently hosted in Florence, Italy (2022) and Prizren, Kosovo (2023).
